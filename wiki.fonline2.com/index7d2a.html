Good job everyone who cooperated with me so we could create this update. Everyone gets something to play with. Enjoy the game and see you on the wasteland!&lt;br>
Don't stop reporting bugs, fellas.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
If anyone finds terrible exploit in mariposa, he is tasked to report it to us. Not reporting will result in severe punishment, reporting will reward player with million bottlecaps and level 99 hintbook.
Don't try to be smart. You won't get it for some minor bug.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
There is going to be one mariposa bomb I will place in one of dungeons, somewhere around it.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
Most propably I will also tommorow test nonpvp event feature by organizing something in non protected town, we will see.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
We also welcome new GM in our ranks. Balthasar.&lt;br>
&lt;br>

'''&lt;span style="color: darkgreen">FEATURES:'''&lt;/span>&lt;br>

'''&lt;span style="color: teal">Global Technology Progression System&lt;/span>&lt;br>

One of the biggest FOnline problem was always ability to grind high tier stuff in short period of time. Lower tier level items were totaly useless. Session gameplayability was rapidly ending  - togheter with full carpets of loot in players tents. There was only really short period of time after wipe, when players could actually fight with low tier weapons and feel like in original Fallouts.

We have implemented totally pioneer, orginal and revolutionising feature, which is called  Global Technology Progression System.
It's purpose is to give FOnline players, Fallout feeling while playing the game, prolonge session gameplayability and make game more interesting.

What is Global Technology Progression System?

Game world technology starts from tier0 (items available without having any profession).

More advanced items are discovered one by one (from the weakest to the strongest) by Players, by finding blueprints for them. Technology is slowly increasing depending from players actions.&lt;br>&lt;br>
After fixed numbers of Players dicovers specific numbers of blueprints for that single item - its getting unblocked for all other players to craft. (knowledge gots spread thru world).&lt;br>&lt;br>
But only those who has Blueprints can benefit from crafting that item with a chance for crafting statistic bonuses.

Blueprints for items can be obtained in:

- Dungeons&lt;br>
- Encounter Containers&lt;br>
- Caves Skeletons&lt;br>
- Random Global Events&lt;br>
- Special Encounters&lt;br>

Only items available currently in technology are appearing in game world (with small exception to Special Encounters).

'''&lt;span style="color: teal">Living World Project&lt;/span>&lt;br>

It is concept to bring more life and create less artifical environment in game wrold. 

There are currently two things taking part in that system (in future we have more in plans):

Automatic Random Global Events:
Over 70 events having different roles and creating various of situations. (more in Global Events Section)

Traveller Script:
It is a script which is creating autonomical NPCs who are acting accordinately to their AI.
Those are autonomical units, who are roaming thru wasteland, dropping in Player's encounters, entering and crossing cities, locations and acting accordinately to thier AI, some of them are friendly some are aggressive, some having quest to give or items to sell.

Some example to be more easy to understand:

- easter eggs characters roaming thru world&lt;br>
- Enclave platoons heading deep into to East&lt;br>
- Raiders bands&lt;br>
- Quest givers&lt;br>
and many others.&lt;br>

'''&lt;span style="color: teal">Random Global Event System&lt;/span>&lt;br>

'''&lt;span style="color: teal">Worldmap Into Wasteland &lt;/span>&lt;br>
is combining 4 features:

1. Ability to meet other player and drop into encounter with him while both players are crossing eachother on Worldmap (Players who want to avoid danger should try to pick less crouded areas)

2. Special notifications about shots being fired in a zone which players is crossing - if there is a players encounter inside.

3. Reworked Turn Base System
There was a big problem with having ability to have 2 turns in a row in turn-base.
We manage to fix that. Que order is different now. If turn-base is already started - player who will enter encounter as a new person - will be forced in next que on the top of the players list. By this Player who spawn during already existing tb que - will have at least a chance to find some cover or try to escape in his first round in next tb que which will be before turn of players who were present in encounter before and took 
good position.

Also there is no option by this to have 2 turns in a row which was causing insta kills.

4. New Encounter Spawning System
One of the biggest problem with encounters, traps, turn base fights was unability to spawn in others players 
encounters without sure death.
Player who was inside had just huge advantage over a Player who was about to spawn. Not to mention specificly
designed Turn-based Traps.

We totally redesigned spawning system.
Now it depends from players Perception.
There are "Circles" of spawn depending from Players perception.
Mobs are spawning in the center of encounter.
Around the center are spawning Players with perception from 1 to 4.
More far away (and often in pretty good position or even hidden behind some obsticle) are spawning players with Perception from 5 to 7.
The best spawning posistion have Players with Perception from 8 to 10. They are spawning on the edges of encounter, very often hidden behind obsticle.

What does it change ?

Now just single player who want some action, can just enter any other players encounter and have a really big chances that will spawn in a good place to start the fight. If the challenge turns out to be to big, he will 
be that close to the exit grid that there are big chances that he can try to escape.

System containing also params which are effecting in spawning Players always at the entire most far away from MOBS or other Players. By this chances are even bigger. Making traps will be a lot more challenging now, 
making "death circle" aroung mobs spawn wont be that effective anymore.

All those features above are changing the look of Worlmap and giving ability for real action for everyone.

'''&lt;span style="color: green">NCR ROLEPLAYING PROJECT&lt;/span>'''&lt;br>

NCR has been trough many changes to try and deliver a better rp experience, a reason for them to defend town and expand, and also drastically reduce gm influence from the town systems. &lt;br>
&lt;br>
2 Weeks after wipe first in game election will begin. The president will be chosen by players with citizenship and President will be elected for 2 months.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
Since there will be no leader at start of the game, I need to ask NCR and Rangers leaders to create the list of players and their in game names. Those players will be added to factions and after president is elected, he will choose Rangers leader and both of them will need to manage their faction officers themselves.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
Town Profit.&lt;br>
Town profit is percentage of the caps (Depending on where it comes from and dynamic economy) from transactions and player actions on the world. This profit will be transferred to Shady Sands bank. &lt;br>
&lt;br>
It comes from:&lt;br>
Caravans (One new route has been added)&lt;br>
Town purchases such as Kevlar and bases.&lt;br>
NCR courier quests.&lt;br>
Town control.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
Town control changes.&lt;br>
The NCR will not get loot from town TC boxes, but the captured town will deliver tax per hour to the town's bank.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
Collecting the tax.&lt;br>
Shady Sands bank event will randomly start if there are more than a few NCR players in the game. The global message will be
announced. NCR people will have some time to gear up and gather up to defend the bank. After few minutes the vault will open and
everyone will be able to take away town profit, even raiders. That's why NCR needs to organize and defend their town.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
NCR Main Gate.&lt;br>
Ncr is now suited with a new interesting feature. The Town entrance force field. It can be used to cut off raiders from the inner 
city, however, if the force field is disabled by ncr people, it will be put on cool down for a while before it can be 
reactivated. Additionally, raiders can use Dynamite to blow up the force field. So NCR soldiers should defend it or they will 
lose their choke point.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
President features.&lt;br>
President will now have access to president's suite. (The old purchasable house in NCR) The suite is outfitted with Escape route, 
Entrance for president from the world map, nice amount of containers and President console which can be used for three things.&lt;br>
Giving Citizenship.&lt;br>
Giving Pardon. (Karma reset for player)&lt;br>
Turning suite forcefields off and on.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
Citizenship.&lt;br>
Players will be able to get Citizenship. They will then have [Citizen] visible over their names for ncr army and rangers. NCR is advised to treat them as their people, and will be penaltized when they will assault such citizen in hometown, however, wasteland doesn't follow the rules and how they will interact with each other is purely players choice.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
Player will lose citizenship forever (Unless president will Award it to him again) if he will perform offensive action such as attacking or stealing inside town of Shady Sands.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
The only requirement to become citizen is to have a level higher than 10 and have no negative karma for NCR. Player will need to sign in and wait a few hours to get it.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
Changes and fixes.&lt;br>
Guards act differently now. They spawn no caps and ammo upon death. Only the weapon they were weilding.&lt;br>
Guard will delete previous weapon after they are awarded with a new one by NCR player.&lt;br>
Guards will not respawn. They will be removed and new soldier will spawn from Rangers base to take his place, which also means that guard resets his weapon to basic weapon after death.&lt;br>
Guards don't have global vision anymore, but they will inform each other to storm aggressors in packs.&lt;br>
Town attack messages were changed. There is now only one global message when first guard gets killed.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
New NCR also contains some changes which are too small to be mentioned and all of the annoying bugs (Weapon giving bug, accessing base bug for ncr army) were fixed. There are also some secrets. ;)&lt;br>
&lt;br>
I hope you will love the freshened out RP experience i've tried to deliver and enjoy the Third FOnline2 Session!

There will be various types of events, happening in public locations, encounters visible from worldmap, some new locations appearing on worldmap, some of the events announced by timer like on Town Control some of them announced thru radio messages, some not announced at all so only the players lucky enough to cross some spot on WM or be inside some location will notice them. Such events are supposed to bring more life to game and world, motivate players to participate, interact, be something interesting to do.

As first event set for tests and feedback we put:

Enclave SF Docks Supply
Enclave is on with its offensive to the East. San Francisco already obeyed under heavy boots of Enclave Troopers.
SF Docs is a perfect place to reinforce nearby ongoing operations by highly needed to be restocked supplies.
Every single man who is against brutal Enclave invasion threatning order and lifes of humble wastelanders should try to put on some resist.
...Ofcourse such situation is also a very tempting opportunity for some nearby scums, smelling high rewards and a fresh blood possible to spill.
