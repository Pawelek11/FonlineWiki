{{quote|&lt;i>You encounter: A small village by the mountainside.&lt;/i>}}

A small village by the mountainside, also referred as Primitive Village or Power Armor Village is one of the most desired by players special encounter. When found the village is being shown as a just another pointless place with no good loot nor challengeful NPCs enemies. But is this really correct? Look deeper and you shall find a truth. 

First of all try to talk to a tribal leader located in the front of one of the tents. He will tell you to leave. Hmmps as if! Instead of leaving browse through the tents and go inside the garage on the right side. You will notice a Brotherhood Hummer being parked there(nope, you can't lockpick it). Go back to big tribal boss. This time this men will be a bit more talkative. And also as you soon realize a bit crazy as well. Okay, not bit - rather totally fucked up. Shoot 'Em Up Smith!

The fight might be a bit tough as while tribal aren't equipped well, the boss itself is a beast. He can do massive damage in very short time due to aimed hand-to-hand attack which he seems to use very well(he basically could say: "I know Kung-Fu."). Try not to fight surrounded by enemy because while damage from other tribal is minimal they will be often causing a knockdown or knock out on your character giving its boss enough time to finish you up. The solution? Run to cover and with with your back sticked to the wall. 

After fight is done its time to collect the loot. On now cold tribal leader's body you can find Brotherhood's Dogtags (which seems to doesn't have any use.), one of tribal is holding very rare weapon - wooden stick (its seriously very rare, as far as i know this is the only place in 

the whole game where you can obtain it. Better take it with you for purpose of keeping in base in "rare stuff" section.) also some other tribal might carry some randoms spears and knifes. Is that all? 

'''Nope.'''

In the main tent close to bath filled with blood, you will find a locked container. Open it - you can lock pick it even with lock pick skill set on as low as 25% (but then you will need a lot of tries!). Inside you will find a Barrett's Power Armor!

==Dialog Log==

{| class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed wikitable"
! Spoilers Ahead!
|-

&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tribal:&lt;/b>&lt;i>Leave now.&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Player Character:&lt;/b>&lt;i>What is the meaning of this? There is a Hummer and crates with the Brotherhood insignia inside that shack! You don't look like a tribal, you're from the Brotherhood aren't you?&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tribal:&lt;/b>&lt;i>No, I'm not. I was a member of the Brotherhood, but that was a long time ago. Now I am the master of my own destiny.&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Player Character:&lt;/b>&lt;i>You left?&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tribal:&lt;/b>&lt;i>It was I who was left. They sent me and with some rookies on a pacification sortie, after some scribes went missing during a diplomatic mission in a village in the mountains north of here. When we showed up, their warriors rushed at us, of course, they had no chance and got slaughtered, only women and children remained.&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Player Character:&lt;/b>&lt;i>And?&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Player Character:&lt;/b>&lt;i>We saw what they did to those Scribes. I've seen many things in my life, but that...That was really something. Meanwhile, those under my command assumed the mission is over, and began to load our comrades bodies on the Hummer.&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Player Character:&lt;/b>&lt;i>Uh... And the what?&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tribal:&lt;/b>&lt;i>What do you think? I came over to the tent where the remnant of the tribe ran to. And then I started shooting. My subordinates tried to stop me, but failed and got themselves killed.&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Player Character:&lt;/b>&lt;i>No way.&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tribal:&lt;/b>&lt;i>Believe what you want, that is the truth. I spared only the smallest of children, and took them with me. I knew my purpose, and the Brotherhood was too weak to further my ultimate goal.&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Player Character:&lt;/b>&lt;i>So, these people are those children? You're a murderer who wants to play God!&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tribal:&lt;/b>&lt;i>No. You see, i had a dream. I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor. Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight razor... and surviving.&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Player Character:&lt;/b>&lt;i>What?&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Tribal:&lt;/b>&lt;i>I have seen horrors, horrors that you have never seen. But you have no right to call me a murderer. You have no right to judge me. It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do know what horror means. Horror! Horror has a face, and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not, they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies. And now, you are going to meet them, as a dead man.&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Player Character:&lt;/b>&lt;i>You are nuts.&lt;/i>&lt;br>
&lt;b>Combat Starts.&lt;/b>&lt;br>

The Tribal Leader speaks about village that you will visit when doing quest "America the beautiful". Surprisingly there are still tribal living at that place, contrary to what he said about killing them all. Weird isn't it?

==How to clear this place without weapons==

This is no longer possible. The tribals can no longer run thus, tribal leader will always be the first to get close to you.

! Not longer the case, but its a wall of text so its shame to delete it.

So you are naked. You are just going back from respawn point, has your game being set in rt and you encounter this. "I'm fucked, kurwa, kurwa what a shame" you think to yourself, then you leave a location, is that right? No! Turn off panic mode and start thinking. You are going to kill every last of this tribal and loot the armor. And i am going to tell you how you will make it. First look at the ground. Find a flint. what can you make with a flint? A Primitive tool! Why would you make it? Because this weapon has range 2. And this is what you exactly need. Now next part is going to be tricky and will require some know karate. Attack the tribal standing next to the garage. Then run as fast as you can to the garage. You need to stand on one hex &lt;b>after&lt;/b> the doors. The tribal will go after you. If you have placed yourself correctly now only one of them will be able to attack you. Before you start whole operation make sure you have localized the hex where you should be standing. the whole point of this action is to be in following scenario: lots of tribal trying to get into building, one of them standing in the door hex next to you. The confusing part is that you can't be the one standing in the doors as then you would be being attacked from 3 sides. You need to stand one hex after the doors hex. I know this description its very confusing but try to re-read this part, then look at the exemplary image. Try to imagine how the NPCs will move. OK? 

[[File:haczyk.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Confused where the hex &lt;b>after&lt;/b> doors is? Here take a look.]]

This is part A. Now the part B. The tribal standing in the doors will be armed in knife or some other weapon like that. He's damage output will be very small. You will be able to heal yourself faster than he can do damage to you(well assuming you got at lest like 150%  points in first aid i guess). As you can see he's not a thread, ignore him and use the advantage of your primitive tool! What advantage? It has range 2 which means you can attack the tribal standing after the one attacking you. At some point you will be able to attack Tribal leader while he can't attack you! What if you have really low close combat skill? Here comes the second very important advantage of primitive tool - it has increased chance to hit (a weapon perk) so no matter how low is your close combat skill a primitive tool is all you need! 

Remember do not kill the tribal standing in the doorway. He's your shield and your protector. Once he's gone there will be nothing protecting you from huge threat of fearsome tribal leader.

This will take a while especially if you don't have a high close combat skill, but eventually you will kill all of them. Once again i know this method is a bit confusing especially if you aren't very experienced, read it fully and try to understand each point of the trick before trying to use it. It might be good to try to ask about it other players on FOnline 2 IRC to explain to you which points of this plan you don't get. 

This is not a abuse, i think the creator of special encounter wanted to give blacksuit players a way to do it.

&lt;b>Note:&lt;/b> You can also use a Shovel or Hatchet which can be found in one of the containers. But the Primitive tool way is the more cool way.
